              As a student with a deep love for animals, I created Happy Tails to share my passion for dogs and cats with others. What began as a personal project has blossomed into a valuable resource for anyone seeking to learn more about their future furry companions. With detailed breed profiles, expert advice, and practical tips, our goal is to help you make informed decisions about pet ownership and care.
